	abstract = {Human languages contain very little unconditioned variation. In contexts where language learners are exposed to input that contains inconsistencies, they tend to regularise it, either by eliminating competing variants, or conditioning variant use on the context. In the present study we compare regularisation behaviour across linguistic levels, looking at how adult learners respond to variability in morphology and word order. Our results suggest similar strengths in regularisation between linguistic levels given input languages whose complexity is comparable.},
